# Game Setup
Configures Windows screen resolution, GPU overclocking profile (using MSI Afterburner), and opens game launcher

## Configuration
1. Download the game_setup directory and copy it to your Documents directory in Windows (e.g. C:\Users\gregh\Documents\game_setup)
2. Download ChangeScreenResolution.exe from https://tools.taubenkorb.at/change-screen-resolution/ and place it in the directory
3. Drag the desired shortcuts from the game_setup directory to your task bar
   For example, if you want to game in 1080p and use 1440p for everyday tasks, drag the "Switch to HD (Game)" and "Switch to 2K (Regular)" shorcuts to your taskbar

If you don't have a high refresh rate monitor, you can remove the /f=144 from the .bat scripts or set it to your refresh rate
